## Acknowledgement
We acknowledge the Antibody facility at The Institute of Cancer Research for providing Antibodies. Their support was instrumental in achieving the results presented in this paper [[10.5281/zenodo.14748209](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.14748209)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.14748209)

## Service Description
# Antibody facility

### Institute of Cancer Research  
Welcome to the Antibody Facility! We specialize in developing custom, high-quality single-chain variable fragment (scFv) antibodies to support scientists and researchers in their discoveries. Our primary technology, phage display, allows us to create antibodies that are highly specific to your target protein, ensuring precision and reliability for your research. This technique enables us to quickly test a wide range of antibody candidates and select the best ones that work against your protein of interest.

Our goal is to make top-quality antibodies affordable and accessible for the academic community, especially for researchers at the Institute of Cancer Research. We perform biopanning against your antigen to select antibody clones that specifically bind to your target. Each selected clone is then tested with ELISA to confirm its binding accuracy, and the sequence is further validated using PCR and sequencing. Once confirmed, the antibody clones are provided to your research team. Since our facility has limited capacity for purification, we leave the final antibody purification and validation to your research team.

At the Antibody Facility, we are committed to helping you achieve your research goals with quality and efficiency. We look forward to working together.
